# Custom Breeze Dark

This is a custom theme for Visual Studio Code that takes the [KDE Breeze Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kde.breeze) theme editor colors and mixes it with the default Dark+ theme syntax colors.

There are a few colors that have been changed from the default Dark+ theme:
- Comments are now gray instead of green
- Strings and css property values are now mint green
